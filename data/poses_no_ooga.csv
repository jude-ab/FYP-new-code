Perfect alignment indicates the correct posture of padmasana.","Padmasana allows the body to be held completely steady for long periods of time. It holds the trunk and head like a pillar with the legs as the firm foundation. As the body is steadied, the mind becomes calm. This steadiness and calmness is the first step towards real meditation. Padmasana directs the flow of prana from mooladhara chakra in the perineum to sahasrara chakra in the head, heightening the experience of meditation. This posture applies pressure to the lower spine, which has a relaxing effect on the nervous system. The breath becomes slow, muscular tension is decreased and blood pressure is reduced. The normally large blood flow to the legs is redirected to the abdominal region. This activity also stimulates the digestive process.",inhale or exhale,focus on the breath,Beginners,yoga_images/padmasana_(lotus_pose).jpg,
65f08d051bad35f99effc0a1,52,Siddha Yoni Asana (accomplished pose for women),"Sit with the legs straight in front of the body. Bend the right leg, placing the sole of the foot flat against the inner left thigh and the heel firmly against the groin. Adjust the body position so that there is comfortable pressure of the right heel. Bend the left leg and wedge the left toes down into the space between the right calf and thigh. Grasp the toes of the right foot and pull them up into the space between the left calf and thigh. The left heel is above the right heel and may exert a light pressure against the public bone. 102 Again adjust the position so that it is comfortable. Ensure that the knees are firmly on the ground. Make the spine fully erect and straight as though it were planted solidly in the earth. Place the hands on the knees is chin, jnana or chinmaya mudra. Close the eyes and relax the whole body.","Siddha Yoni Asana directs the energy from the lower psychic centres upward through the spine, stimulating the brain and calming the entire nervous system. The position of the lower foot at the perineum presses mooladhara chakra, stimulating moola bandha, and the pressure applied to the pubic bone presses the trigger point for swadhisthana, automatically activating vajroli/sahajoli mudra. These two psycho-muscular locks redirect sexual nervous impulses back up the spinal cord to the brain, establishing control over the reproductive hormones which is necessary in order to maintain brahmacharya for spiritual purposes. Prolonged periods in siddhasana result in noticeable tingling sensations in the mooladhara region, which may last for ten to fifteen minutes. This is caused by a reduction in the blood supply to the area and by a rebalancing of the pranic flow in the lower chakras. This posture redirects blood circulation to the lower spine and abdomen, toning the lumbar region of the spine, the pelvis and the abdominal organs, and balancing the reproductive system and the blood pressure.",inhale or exhale,focus on the breath,Beginners,yoga_images/siddha_yoni_asana_(accomplished_pose_for_women).jpg,

Relax the hands and arms.,"Jnana mudra and chin mudra are simple but important psycho-neural finger locks which make meditation asanas more powerful. The palms and fingers of the hands 425 have many nerve root endings which constantly emit energy.

When the fingers and hands are placed on the knees, the knees are sensitized, creating another pranic circuit that maintains and redirects prana within the body. In addition, placing the hands on the knees stimulates a nadi which runs from the knees, up the inside of the thighs and into the perineum. This nadi is known as gupta or the hidden nadi. Sensitizing this channel helps to stimulate the energies at mooladhara chakra. When the palms face upward in chin mudra, the chest area is opened up.

The palms and fingers of the hands 425 have many nerve root endings which constantly emit energy. When the index finger touches the thumb, a circuit is produced which allows the energy that would normally dissipate into the environment to travel back through the body and up to the brain. When the fingers and hands are placed on the knees, the knees are sensitized, creating another pranic circuit that maintains and redirects prana within the body. In addition, placing the hands on the knees stimulates a nadi which runs from the knees, up the inside of the thighs and into the perineum. This nadi is known as gupta or the hidden nadi. Sensitizing this channel helps to stimulate the energies at mooladhara chakra. When the palms face upward in chin mudra, the chest area is opened up.

It should ideally be practised before sleep; before, during and after asana practice, particularly after dynamic exercises such as surya namaskara; and when the practitioner feels physically and mentally tired.

65f08d051bad35f99effc0a0,51,Siddhasana (accomplished pose for men),"Sit with the legs straight in front of the body. Bend the right leg and place the sole of the foot flat against the inner left thigh with the heel pressing the perineum (the area midway between the genitals and anus). Bend the left leg. Push the toes and the outer edge of the left foot into the space between the right calf and thigh muscles. If necessary, this space may be enlarged slightly by using the hands or temporarily adjusting the position of the right leg. Place the left ankle directly over the right ankle so that the ankle bones are touching and the heels are one above the other. Press the pubis with the left heel directly above the genitals. The genitals will therefore lie between the two heels. If this last position is too difficult, simply place the left heel as near as possible to the pubis. Grasp the right toes and pull them up into the space between the left calf and thigh. Again adjust the body so that it is comfortable. Sit on top of the right heel. This is an important aspect of 100 siddhasana. Adjust the body until it is comfortable and the pressure of the heel is firmly applied. The legs should now be locked, with the knees touching the ground and the left heel directly above the right heel. Make the spine erect and feel as though the body is fixed on the floor. Place the hands on the knees in jnana, chin or chinmaya mudra. Close the eyes and relax the whole body. Siddhasana may be performed with either leg \nuppermost. Many people experience discomfort due to \nthe pressure applied where the ankles cross each other. If \nnecessary, place a folded cloth or piece of sponge between \nthe legs at this point. At first the pressure at the perineum \nmay be uncomfortable to maintain, but with practice this \nwill be eased.","Siddhasana directs the energy from the lower psychic centres upward through the spine, stimulating the brain and calming the entire nervous system. The position of the lower foot at the perineum presses mooladhara chakra, stimulating moola bandha, and the pressure applied to the pubic bone presses the trigger point for swadhisthana, automatically activating vajroli/sahajoli mudra. These two psycho-muscular locks redirect sexual nervous impulses back up the spinal cord to the brain, establishing control over the reproductive hormones which is necessary in order to maintain brahmacharya for spiritual purposes. Prolonged periods in siddhasana result in noticeable tingling sensations in the mooladhara region, which may last for ten to fifteen minutes. This is caused by a reduction in the blood supply to the area and by a rebalancing of the pranic flow in the lower chakras. This posture redirects blood circulation to the lower spine and abdomen, toning the lumbar region of the spine, the pelvis and the abdominal organs, and balancing the reproductive system and the blood pressure.",inhale or exhale,focus on the breath,Beginners,yoga_images/siddhasana_(accomplished_pose_for_men).jpg,
